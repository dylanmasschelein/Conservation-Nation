# Conservation Nation

üå≥ Conservation Nation provides users the ability to learn about designated protected areas across the globe üå≥  

This project is the final capstone project for BrainStations Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  The goal was to conceptualize, propose, plan and execute a full stack application within 2 weeks. Conservation Nation was built using React, SASS, and Leaflet (mapping API) for the front end, Node/Express for the backend, along with JWT token for Auth. MongoDB/Mongoose was used as my NoSQL database to manage over 175,000 area objects and users data.

Watch my demo!: https://lnkd.in/dGzF7H8  
Checkout the deployed application: https://conservation-nation.herokuapp.com/

Since the completion of the program, I have implemented further technologies into the project to familiarize myself with new concepts, these include:  
‚≠ê Heroku for full-stack deployment  
‚≠ê Redux, React-Redux, and @Reduxjs/toolkit (Full application state not yet managed glabally)  
‚≠ê React-media (JavaScript media query library)  

I am taking a break for a few weeks to learn some new technologies and build another application  

üß¨ Next Steps üß¨  
üîß Minify GeoJSON files - When searching countries with large amounts of areas (ie. Canada) there will be a long loading time   
üîß Refactor to use MVC architecture  
üîß Add additional info about areas and taxons (descriptions, articles, recent news etc...)  
üîß Planning to make over some UI/UX to make the app more intuitive to navigate  

Tips for navigation:  
    ‚û°Ô∏è "Where To" will bring up the navigation bar in tablet screen and larger  
    ‚û°Ô∏è Search a country in the search bar  
    ‚û°Ô∏è Click on a protected area  
    ‚û°Ô∏è Click the explore button  
    ‚û°Ô∏è Then freely select the icons that appear on the map  
    ‚û°Ô∏è Reapeat!!  

‚≠ê Please let me know if have any questions at all! I will surely be at my computer! :)  
‚≠ê Thank you to for your interest and happy exploring!
