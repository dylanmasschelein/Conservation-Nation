# Conservation Nation

🌳 Conservation Nation provides users the ability to learn about designated protected areas across the globe 🌳  

This project is the final capstone project for BrainStations Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  The goal was to conceptualize, propose, plan and execute a full stack application within 2 weeks. Conservation Nation was built using React, SASS, and Leaflet (mapping API) for the front end, Node/Express for the backend, along with JWT token for Auth. MongoDB/Mongoose was used as my NoSQL database to manage over 175,000 area objects and users data.
