# Conservation Nation

üå≥ Conservation Nation provides users the ability to learn about designated protected areas across the globe üå≥  

This project is the final capstone project for BrainStations Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  The goal was to conceptualize, propose, plan and execute a full stack application within 2 weeks. Conservation Nation was built using React, SASS, and Leaflet (mapping API) for the front end, Node/Express for the backend, along with JWT token for Auth. MongoDB/Mongoose was used as my NoSQL database to manage over 175,000 area objects and users data.

üß¨ Next Steps üß¨  
‚≠ê Minify GeoJSON files - When searching countries with large amounts of areas, loading will take a bit  
‚≠ê Implement Redux to manage all application state  
‚≠ê Refactor to use MVC architecture  
‚≠ê Add additional info about areas and taxons (descriptions, articles, recent news etc...)  

‚≠ê Please let me know if have any questions at all! I will surely be at my computer! :)  
‚≠ê Thank you to for your interest and happy exploring!
