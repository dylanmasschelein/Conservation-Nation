# Conservation Nation

- Conservation Nation provides users the ability to learn about designated protected areas across the globe in a simple and interactive way \*

- For simple project setup, download the repository and npm install dependencies on both client and server \*
- I have added you to my MongoDB cluster as Admin so you should have no problem connecting the project to the DB from your computer \*
- .env files => Use these in for the server side (no data necessary for client) -- you can find this info in the text document from synapse \*

** Notes about project **

=> File upload functionality not completed when submitted, may be there once you look at it in github though
=> There are some dependencies left in for future implementation
=> There are some server side routes that are not yet completed

- Please let me know if you run into any questions at all! I will surely be at my computer! \*
- Thank you to for all of your guidence and leadership throughout the course!! It's been an absolute blast!
